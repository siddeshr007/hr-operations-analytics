HR Operations / Attrition Analytics

This project analyzes employee attrition (turnover) for an HR/Operations team using:

- **Excel** for KPIs, pivot tables, and an interactive dashboard  
- **MySQL** for SQL-based analysis  
- **BA-style documentation** of findings and recommendations  

The dataset is the well-known **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition** dataset (publicly available).

## 🎯 Business Question

> The company is experiencing high employee attrition and wants to understand:
> - Which departments and roles are losing people the fastest  
> - Which age and tenure segments are at highest risk  
> - What actions HR can take to reduce attrition

📊 Excel Analysis & Dashboard
Steps in Excel
Loaded the raw CSV and saved as hr_attrition.xlsx.

Created helper fields:

AgeBand (groups ages into <25, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55+)

AttritionFlag (1 if Attrition = "Yes", else 0)

Built PivotTables to analyze attrition:

By Department

By Job Role

By Age Band

By YearsAtCompany

Built an interactive dashboard in hr_attrition_dashboard.xlsx with:

KPIs:

Total Employees

Attrition Count

Attrition Rate (%)

Charts:

Attrition by Department (bar chart)

Attrition by Age Band (column chart)

Attrition by Years at Company (line chart)

Slicers for:

Department

Gender

Marital Status

To view the dashboard, open
excel/hr_attrition_dashboard.xlsx
and go to the Dashboard sheet.

🧮 SQL / MySQL Analysis
The file sql/hr_attrition_mysql.sql contains the main queries used to reproduce the Excel pivots in MySQL.

Key queries include:

Attrition rate by department

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Department,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS attrition_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;
Attrition rate by job role

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    JobRole,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS attrition_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY JobRole
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;
Attrition rate by age band (same logic as Excel AgeBand field)

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 25 THEN '<25'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 25 AND 34 THEN '25-34'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 35 AND 44 THEN '35-44'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 45 AND 54 THEN '45-54'
        ELSE '55+'
    END AS age_band,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS attrition_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY age_band
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;
Attrition rate by years at company

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    YearsAtCompany,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS attrition_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY YearsAtCompany
ORDER BY YearsAtCompany ASC;
🔍 Key Insights (from dashboard & SQL)
Some of the main findings (using this dataset):

Overall attrition is around 16%.

Sales and HR departments have higher attrition rates than R&D.

Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians are among the highest-risk roles.

Attrition is highest for employees under 25 and within their first 0–3 years at the company.

Senior roles (Directors, Managers) have relatively low attrition.

These insights feed into the recommendations documented in docs/ba_report.md.

🧾 BA-Style Report
The file docs/ba_report.md summarizes the project like a Business Analyst would:

Methods (how attrition rate was calculated, what segments were analyzed)

Key findings

Actionable recommendations, such as:

Improving onboarding and early-tenure experience (0–3 years)

Targeted retention for Sales & specific high-risk roles

Monitoring demographic patterns (Gender, Marital Status) using slicers

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

🚀 How to Reproduce
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/siddeshr007/hr-operations-analytics.git
Open excel/hr_attrition_dashboard.xlsx in Excel to explore the dashboard.

To run the SQL:
